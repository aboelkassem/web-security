# Pentesting Methodology
- Query Parameters
    - If the parameter name takes URL… then maybe a SSRF or Open Redirection vulnerabilities
    - If the parameter name takes file name … then maybe Local file inclusion or disclosure
    - If the parameter or any inputs takes XML .. then maybe XXE vuln
- For Search feature ⇒ always try SQL Injection or XSS
- Recon VS information gathering
    - Recon: Is more technical/General in bug hunting like collects IPs or Subdomains, Autonomous System numbers ASN
    - Information gathering: understand the business value or cases of the target
 
### 1- Scoping and Information Gathering

- Understand the app business
- Collect data (perform Recon) Wapplazer, Dirsearch tool, view source code (inspect), github
- Understand the different system's users and roles, then try creating two users for each role

### 2- Scanning

- Focus on one vulnerability unless you find a clear one.
- More focus on logical and access control vuln
- Use burp auto scan while you are doing a manual scan
- You should have clear steps/plan for your target and vuln types

### 3- Exploitation

- Provide (Prof of concept) POC without damaging the app

### 4- Reporting

- always write what you found in notion or OneNote

## Tools

- Use OneNote for writing
- Use AutoHotKey
- Burp plugins NGINX Alais Traversal, J2EEScan, Upload Tester
    - NGINX Alais Traversal: Plugin for auto scan nginx servers for path traversal
    - J2EEScan: Try CVEs on the target
    - Upload Scanner: File upload scanner
    - Autorize: Privilege escalation tool
